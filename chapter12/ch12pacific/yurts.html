            <h3>What is a yurt?</h3>
            <p>
              Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the
              ground. Each yurt is a closed off home with wooden floors, canvas
              walls and a roof dome that can be opened.

            <h3>How are the yurts finished?</h3>
            <p>
              Each yurt is finished with a huge queen sized bed with silk
              sheets. They also include electricity and running water. Both
              showers and restrooms are located in the lodge, used publicly by
              other yurts.
            </p>

            <h3>What should I bring?</h3>
            <p>
              Most travelers bring comfortable running or walking shoes. They
              also bring light colored clothes that don't contain many layers
              because of the heat. Bringing a flashlight may help too, if you
              decide to go on a night walk.
