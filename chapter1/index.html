    <p>My favorite coffee is a simple mocha. It is not too sweet nor bitter and taste very delicious when cold. The coffee shop I usually go to is a small one in downtown San Diego by the pier. They make all their coffee really good. So good that I even try new ones every time I go there, and they never disappoint.</p>
