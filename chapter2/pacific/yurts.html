        <dt><strong>What is a yurt?</strong></dt>
        <dd>
          Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground.
          Each yurt is a closed off home with wooden floors, canvas walls and a
          roof dome that can be opened.
        </dd>
        <dt><strong>How are the yurts finished?</strong></dt>
        <dd>
          Each yurt is finished with a huge queen sized bed with silk sheets.
          They also include electricity and running water. Both showers and
          restrooms are located in the lodge, used publicly by other yurts.

        <dt><strong>What should I bring?</strong></dt>
        <dd>
          Most travelers bring comfortable running or walking shoes. They also
          bring light colored clothes that don't contain many layers because of
          the heat. Bringing a flashlight may help too, if you decide to go on a
          night walk.
